1. Whiteboard sketch lifetime
    -> usually drawings stay on a wall for 1-5 days until it is obvious that no one is using it anymore and it gets erased for use by someone else
    -> people often come back to a sketch the same day it was created to further discuss and add to /edit the drawing
    -> taking photos is usually not useful for the following reasons 
        -> it puts the sketch in one person's hands and they usually don't share it because there is not a lot of value
        -> it is not editable after the fact
