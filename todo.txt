# movable square
    * create node project w/ socket.io (DONE)
    * clicking screen on one browser tab does console log on other and vice versa (DONE)
    * master/slave
        -> slave sends master coordinates and master draws a box
        -> slave can move box on master by clicking and dragging mouse
        
    * connect ipad and see how it works


# whiteboard
    * I draw a red line on one and it draws on the other screen


# integrate
    * when I connect I get a static non movable square
    * I draw a red line on one and it draws on other screen within rectangle
        -> square is same aspect ratio but different size
        -> line must be translated
    * make the square movable
        -> have a toggle state button in bottom right
            -> drawing state
            -> square moving state

        -> when going into square moving state I erase everything in background whiteboard
        -> when moving rectangle I resend coordinates to master so it knows where to draw lines
