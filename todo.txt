# bugs
    -> sending drawing while disconnected keeps drawing in buffer (does not send once connected)
    -> drawing in small rect then drawing in larger rect increases stroke size of all drawings

# next
    -> icons for usability
    -> show disconnected message on tablet
    -> show connected message on desktop
    -> when tablet disconnects remove square 
    -> play background onto ipad for reference 
    -> panning physics
    -> prevent box from going over bounds when panning / zooming
    -> offer way to clear whiteboard and it gets cleared everywhere


# ideas
    -> use it to make presentations
    -> grids
    -> zoom drawing on large screen
    -> kinect integration
    -> accelerometer to draw
    -> launch android intent to overlay transparent whiteboard onto anything android is displaying
    -> make arrows light up when it starts going in a certain direction
    -> boxes travels faster further you pull it one way
    -> weatherman on top of drawing?
    -> pointer?

# done
    -> full screen control and tap to enable/disable
    -> see drawing beneath control square
    -> zoom


# from HCI course
1.  Two people can draw on the same whiteboard from different devices.  It should be easy to share the whiteboard session with someone else to encourage bouncing of ideas.

2.  The ability to draw on a tablet and project it on a large screen so that others can see it clearly.

3.  The ability to draw on different areas of a large screen from a tablet so that they can draw accurately but also have a large drawing surface.  The drawable area is movable and resizable.

4.  Ability to start a drawing session on a large screen rapidly.  Ideally I would just open my drawing application on my device and launch the large screen from there.

5.  Ability to make a more formal presentation with a timeline from the drawing.

6.  Use accelerometer to draw so that person becomes actor again in whiteboard experience.

7.  Recognize when someone is drawing arrow and make the components connecting them draggable with the arrow as a connector always staying between them.

8.  Recognize other symbols such as squares and circles to enclose something and grids / tables as a template.

9.  Enable user to attach other things to the drawing such as images & websites.

10.  Make it very simple to erase certain things from drawing.  Perhaps make it so they can clear the entire drawable area.

11.  It should be easy to save the drawing for later use.

12.  (Perhaps not part of this application) A template creator that enables someone to draw on top of a fitness plan / blueprints / table floor plans.

13.  Show who is connected to make people feel like they are active participants in the brainstorming session.

14.  Show when someone is drawing something (similar to showing that someone is typing something in instant messenger).

15.  Make it possible to group objects then move and delete them.

16.  People can add tags later to a drawing so that it can be easily retrieved by search instead of browsing.

17.  Insert text.   It should be very easy to drag and resize the text.

18.  People can add notes which are pieces of text that add commentary to the drawing but are not part of the drawing itself.
