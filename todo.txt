# bugs
    -> sending drawing while disconnected keeps drawing in buffer (does not send once connected)
    -> drawing in small rect then drawing in larger rect increases stroke size of all drawings

# next
    -> icons for usability
    -> show disconnected message on tablet
    -> show connected message on desktop
    -> when tablet disconnects remove square 
    -> play background onto ipad for reference 
    -> panning physics
    -> prevent box from going over bounds when panning / zooming
    -> offer way to clear whiteboard and it gets cleared everywhere


# ideas
    -> use it to make presentations
    -> grids
    -> zoom drawing on large screen
    -> kinect integration
    -> accelerometer to draw

# done
    -> full screen control and tap to enable/disable
    -> see drawing beneat control square
    -> zoom
